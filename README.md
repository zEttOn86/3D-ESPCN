### 3D Efficient Subpixel-shifted Convolutional Network (3D-ESPCN)

This chainer implementation is based on "Tanno R. et al. (2017) Bayesian Image Quality Transfer with CNNs: Exploring Uncertainty in dMRI Super-Resolution. In: Descoteaux M., Maier-Hein L., Franz A., Jannin P., Collins D., Duchesne S. (eds) Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention âˆ’ MICCAI 2017. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 10433. Springer, Cham".

Note that this is not official implementation.

The difference between original paper and this as follow:

- Dataset

  - I used [Balloon Analog Risk-taking Task dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000001/versions/00006)

- I only implement baseline model (3D-ESPCN).

  - Network architecture

#### Requirements

- chainer

- cupy

- SimpleITK

- pyyaml

#### How to use

1. Download dataset [here](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000001/versions/00006).

    Please put all dataset to `data/raw` after you unzipped it.

2. Make mhd data and LR image

    ```
    # Make mhd data in data/interim
    python util\miscs\clean_data.py

    # Make LR and HR images in data/processed
    python util\miscs\make_lr_img.py
    ```

3. Training model

    ```
    python training.py -g 0
    ```

4. Reconstruct HR image

    ```
    
    ```
